This is my first project made in python during last week with exams, i made this project to start learning about data base programming.

The project is a program like Tinder, made from zero in Python with tkinter for the GUI, and working with Amazon RDS as the database, with SQL queries and designed in Ubuntu 20.04.

As a user, you can create an account and log, see a map with your location , and chat with some users inserted before.You can create 2 new accounts with a valid location, and both in the same City,Province,Country, changing between them you can chat do a match and chat with the other account, but there is an account Email=a Password=a with some matches already done and a mini-conversation with javier15.

Bug and reports: sometimes the profile update doesn't work well

Sorry for the GUI but i don't control it well, my intention is learn other frameworks and programming languages for the GUI, and improve in the app and web development.

To run the program command: python3 main.py
